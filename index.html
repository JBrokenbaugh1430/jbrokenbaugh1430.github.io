        <p id="aboutme">My name is Jaden Brokenbaugh. I was born in California in 1430AH(2009CE), and was moved with my mom to New Jersey around the age of 6. In 8th grade or so I reverted to Islam.
            <br>
            I'm currently a sophomore at Gloucester County Institute of Technology, studying Computer Science. I started writing this page on 8/6/1446AH(2/5/2025CE).
            <br>
            I know a little Python, HTML, and CSS. If it gets too complicated, I don't really enjoy writing HTML.
